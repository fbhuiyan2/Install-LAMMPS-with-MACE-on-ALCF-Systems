# Installing LAMMPS with MACE on Sophia

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install [LAMMPS](https://lammps.org/) with the [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) package on Sophia, adapting the successful installation from Polaris. It addresses differences in module availability, compiler settings, network limitations, and environment configurations between Polaris and Sophia.

## Prerequisites
- **Compute Node Access**: On Sophia, compilation must be performed on compute nodes, not login nodes.
- **Project Short Name**: Replace `yourProjectShortName` with your actual project short name in commands.
- **Internet Access**: Compute nodes on Sophia lack internet connectivity. All necessary files must be downloaded on the login nodes and transferred to the compute nodes via a shared filesystem.
- **Shared Filesystem**: Ensure you use directories that are accessible from both login and compute nodes (e.g., your home directory or a project directory).

---

## Step 1: Acquire a Compute Node for Compilation
Since compilation cannot be performed on Sophia's login nodes, request an interactive session on a compute node:

```bash
qsub -I -q workq -A yourProjectShortName -n 1 -t 02:00:00
```
Replace `yourProjectShortName` with your actual project short name.

- **Explanation**:
  - `-I`: Interactive session.
  - `-q workq`: Specifies the queue.
  - `-n 1`: Number of nodes.
  - `-t 02:00:00`: Time allocation (2 hours).

Once you have access to the compute node, proceed with setting up your environment.

## Step 2: Set Up the Environment

### 2.1 Bash Profile Adjustment

For your interactive session, itâ€™s important to source the global profile so that all necessary environment variables and paths are correctly set. Add the following to your job script or profile:

```bash
. /etc/profile
```
